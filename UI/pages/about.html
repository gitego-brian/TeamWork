            <br>
            <br>
            An employee <a href="signup.html">creates an account</a> on TeamWork and from then on they can post articles to be
            viewed by their colleagues, they can edit those articles as many times as they want,
            they can also share their opinions about other employees' articles.

            <div class="about-me">
                I am developing this platform as a project that is part of the application for the Andela fellowship program
                in Kigali, Rwanda where i hope to learn and collaborate with many different people and change my
                community and the world one line at a time.
