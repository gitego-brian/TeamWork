                                The most important thing you can learn from the Avengers is math: ONE is better than one. Meaning that one team is better than one person. This is very different than saying “five is better than one.”

                                Sure, a group of 5 individuals can probably accomplish more than just one person alone…but it is only once that group of 5 becomes ONE that you see the magic happen. When you’re part of a team–a truly cohesive unit that functions with a single purpose–you can accomplish wonders. A single team can do more in a few days than one person can do in a month, or a bunch of individuals can do in a week.

                                The hard part is making those 5 into ONE. Being able to do this requires that all members put their respective egos aside, and trust one another.

                                For the Avengers, this is sometimes hard. Captain America and Iron Man, for example, have pretty different worldview, and compromise doesn’t come easy.
                                But despite their disagreements, they respect and trust one another, because they can see the value each brings to the table. When things get crazy and they really need to work together, they each fall into their roles seamlessly.

                                If you’re going to be part of a truly successful team, you have to learn to let go of a lot of your general attitudes and preconceived notions. You just need to trust in the people around you, and earn their trust as well.

                                While it’s certainly difficult, actively setting aside ego is going to make you a better teammate, better employees, better boss…as well as a better parent, spouse, or friend.

                                The abandonment of ego is what allows you to become part of a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.

                                This hasn’t always been easy for me, and it’s still a challenge.

                                In fact, the only thing that’s really helped me is to be constantly reminded that I don’t know everything, and I can’t do it all on my own. Trying and failing is part of it, but the larger piece of success has simply to become part of a number of teams, and focus on playing ONE specific role, rather than trying to do everything myself.

                            </a>
                            <p>
                                In 1986, shortly after he was forced out of Apple, Steve Jobs bought a small computer
                                manufacturer named (drumroll) Pixar.In 2000, he relocated the company to an
                                abandoned Del Monte canning factory. The original plan called for three buildings,
                                with separate offices for computer scientists, animators, and the Pixar executives.
                                Jobs immediately scrapped it. Instead of three buildings, there was going to be a
                                single vast space, with an atrium at its centre. <br>
                                Brad Bird, the director of “The Incredibles” and “Ratatouille,” said,
                                “The atrium initially might seem like a waste of space.
                                But Steve realised that when people run into each other when they make eye contact, things happen.”

                            </a>
                            <p>
                                Problem-solving is one art or we can say that it is one type of skill.
                                There are so many different types of problems either big or small.
                                It is important how to deal with problems. There are so many options
                                available for that. We have to try for a solution. If that doesn’t work,
                                try another one. If that doesn’t work, repeat until you luck out.
                                Problem-solving skills are almost unanimously the most important qualification
                                that employers look for….more than programming languages proficiency,
                                debugging and system design. This article explains in brief about what we should
                                do when you encounter a new problem and follow the steps to solve a particular problem.
